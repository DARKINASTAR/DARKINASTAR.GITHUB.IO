  I believe cars should have longer longevity and be alot more economical in fuel costs.

  My colleagues spent the last ten years doing research, study and development of **NEW ADVANCED NANOTECHNOLOGY**.
This is, my people, a **REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH** for our DLCC **(Diamond-Like Carbon Coating) is designed to 
be attracted to friction;** kind of like a sticky note, *it's slick on one side--sticky on the other!!*

  When added to engine oil, these **NANOSHEETS ATTACH TO METAL SURFACES** sticky side down sheet by sheet during engine operation.
Leaving the slick side facing outward. A porous layer is deposited on internal components after 500 miles of driving.
**CREATING A HIGH PERFORMANCE WEAR- RESISTANT COATING OF OUR ADVANCED NANOTECHNOLOGY.**

*The Proof Is In The Tube, **It's Time to NANO-UP!! Get particulating world-wide!***
