>I believe cars should have longer longevity and be alot more economical in fuel costs.

>My colleagues spent the last ten years doing research, study and development of **NEW ADVANCED NANOTECHNOLOGY**.  
>This is, my people, a **REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH** for our DLCC **(Diamond-Like Carbon Coating) is designed to 
be attracted to friction;** kind of like a sticky note, *it's slick on one side--sticky on the other!!*

>When added to engine oil, these **NANOSHEETS ATTACH TO METAL SURFACES** sticky side down sheet by sheet during engine operation.
Leaving the slick side facing outward. 
>A porous layer is deposited on internal components after 500 miles of driving.
**CREATING A HIGH PERFORMANCE WEAR-RESISTANT COATING OF OUR ADVANCED NANOTECHNOLOGY.**
